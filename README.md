## Overview

ICU discharge is not the end of the story. For 20% of patients, it's the beginning of a dangerous and costly cycle. This project develops a machine learning model to predict 30-day ICU readmissions using the MIMIC-IV dataset (545,316 admissions from 2008-2019).

**Key Results:**
- **0.683 AUC** on held-out test set (49% better than baseline)
- **$17.25M annual net benefit** for large academic hospitals
- **280% ROI** through targeted intervention
- Correctly identifies **7 of 10 readmissions**

## Abstract

Despite $26 billion in annual readmission costs and penalties for hospitals, predicting which ICU patients will return remains unsolved. We developed a machine learning model using the MIMIC-IV dataset, engineering 57 clinical features from 150+ million raw data points across six interconnected tables.

Using temporal validation (training 2008-2017, testing 2018-2019), we compared logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost models. XGBoost achieved 0.683 AUC, with top predictors being medication count, age, length of stay, and hospital mortality flags—validating multi-dimensional complexity over single-condition flags.

Risk stratification showed the highest-risk 33% of patients contained 52.5% of all readmissions. With 50% greater efficiency than random intervention, the model requires screening only 13 patients to prevent one readmission.

**Critical limitations:** Single-center data limits generalizability, missing post-discharge variables create a performance ceiling, and fairness analysis revealed an 11 percentage point sensitivity disparity between Black and White patient groups requiring group-specific calibration. Prospective validation and randomized pilot testing with ongoing equity monitoring are required before clinical deployment.

## Key Findings

### Model Performance
- **Best Model**: XGBoost with temporal validation
- **AUC**: 0.683 (test set)
- **Sensitivity**: 70% (correctly identifies 7/10 readmissions)
- **Specificity**: Optimized for high-risk patient identification

### Top Predictive Features
1. **Medication count** - Proxy for clinical complexity
2. **Age** - Patient demographics
3. **Length of stay** - Healthcare utilization
4. **Hospital mortality flags** - Risk indicators

### Financial Impact
- **Net Benefit**: $17.25M annually (large academic hospital)
- **ROI**: 280%
- **Efficiency**: Screen 13 patients to prevent 1 readmission
- **Cost per Readmission**: ~$46,000

### Risk Stratification
- Highest-risk **33% of patients** contain **52.5% of readmissions**
- Enables efficient resource allocation
- Targets interventions where they matter most

## Technical Approach

### Data Source
- **MIMIC-IV Database**: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care
- **Size**: 545,316 hospital admissions, 2008-2019
- **Institution**: Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center
- **Access**: Requires credentialed access from PhysioNet

### Feature Engineering
- **57 clinical features** engineered from raw data
- **150+ million data points** across 6 interconnected tables
- Feature categories:
  - Comorbidity indices (Charlson, Elixhauser)
  - Healthcare utilization patterns
  - Medication risk profiles
  - Clinical complexity metrics

### Model Development
- **Temporal validation**: Train 2008-2017, test 2018-2019
- **Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- **Tuning**: Grid search with cross-validation
- **Evaluation**: AUC-ROC, calibration, fairness metrics

### Technologies
- **R**: Primary programming language
- **tidyverse**: Data manipulation
- **xgboost**: Gradient boosting
- **caret**: Model training framework
- **ROCR, pROC**: Model evaluation
- **ggplot2**: Visualizations

## Critical Limitations

1. **Generalizability**: Single-center data (BIDMC) may not transfer to other hospitals
2. **Missing Variables**: No post-discharge data (housing, medication adherence, caregiver support)
3. **Fairness Concerns**: 11pp sensitivity disparity between Black and White patients
4. **Temporal Drift**: Healthcare practices change; model needs regular retraining
